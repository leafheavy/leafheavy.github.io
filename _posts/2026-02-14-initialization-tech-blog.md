Welcome to my newly redesigned blog! I'm excited to share this space where I'll be posting about technology, research, and various projects I'm working on.

## What's New?

This blog has been completely redesigned with several key improvements:

### 1. Consistent Navigation
The navigation bar now appears consistently across all pages, including the blog homepage and individual post pages. No more disappearing menus!

### 2. Apple-Inspired Design
Taking inspiration from Apple's design philosophy, the new blog features:
- Clean, minimalist aesthetics
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Beautiful typography with SF Pro fonts
- Responsive design that works on all devices

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Reading progress bar**: Track your progress through longer articles
- **Share buttons**: Easily share posts on social media
- **Related posts**: Discover more content based on tags
- **Responsive images**: Optimized loading for better performance

## What to Expect

In upcoming posts, I'll be sharing:

- **Technical tutorials** on web development and machine learning
- **Research insights** from my academic work
- **Project showcases** highlighting interesting work
- **Tips and tricks** I've learned along the way

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of how easy it is to include code snippets in posts:

```python
def greet(name):
    """A friendly greeting function"""
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to my blog."

# Usage
message = greet("Reader")
print(message)
```

And here's some JavaScript:

```javascript
const blogPost = {
  title: "Welcome Post",
  date: new Date(),
  tags: ["announcement", "blogging"],
  
  publish() {
    console.log(`Publishing: ${this.title}`);
  }
};

blogPost.publish();
```

## Images and Media

You can easily include images in your posts:

*Caption: A beautiful sample image to demonstrate the image feature*

## Lists and Formatting

### Unordered List
- First item with **bold text**
- Second item with *italic text*
- Third item with `inline code`

### Ordered List
1. Step one: Plan your content
2. Step two: Write your post
3. Step three: Add images and code
4. Step four: Publish!
